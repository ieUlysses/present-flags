Hello and welcome to Presnt Flags, a simple  application working with the renound Rest Countries Api. This project in its mvp form should render a list of the first 4 countries from the API along with the name, currency, region, language and flag. 

Later development plans....
  mobile view using tindercards as a medium for dislplay
   freedom to search for a user specified country which will give  a more detailed view of the country. 
   
  Current Bugs  
   1) Sizing is a little odd of some Flags
   2) useEffect is not exactly working as desired
   3) Pullying language and currency is not working for some reason. 

Thanks for taking the time to visit
